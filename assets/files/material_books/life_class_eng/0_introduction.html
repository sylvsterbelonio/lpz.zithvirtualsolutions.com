   <p class="i" style="text-align:center"><b>Dear Student,</b></p>
   
   <p class="i" style="text-align:center">
        Welcome to <b class="text-primary">LifeClass!</b> Here you will learn how to relate to God personally and how to bring new direction to your life as you begin 
        to understand and apply the simple and practical principles found in these pages. 
   </p>
   
   <p class="j">
        An encounter with Jesus is the most wonderful experience a person can have. Jesus is such an extraordinary person that when I met Him personally, 
        He changed the course of my life so completely that nothing was ever the same again. I vegan to see things through different eyes and from a different perspective. 
        He suddenly brought real meaning to every day and I realized that I had simply open wasting time up until that point. I now wanted to make every second of my life count. 
   </p>
   
   <p class="j">
        I finally understood that we are alive for a reason, and a great desire was awakened in me to do something for God.
   </p>
   
   <p class="j">
      All the changes experienced came as the result of a simple yet sincere prayer. I had asked Jesus to reveal Himself to me then and there if He really existed and if He was the God of the Bible. 
      I did not have to wait long for a response and I soon found myself in the presence of the Author of life. I experienced so many emotions all at once: I cried, I laughed, and 1 worshiped God with all my heart. 
      I had met Jesus in a personal way.    
   </p>
   
   <p class="j">
      The book you are holding in your hands was written to help you take that step and make the decision to have a personal encounter with Jesus. 
      We have carefully designed a series of lessons and activities that will help you grow both personally and spiritually over the next nine weeks.    
   </p>
   
   <p class="j">
    Each week covers a specific topic, which is split up into small chunks so that you can learn a little more about God every day. The lesson for the day will take approximately 15-20 minutes and contains four sec-
    tions: 
   </p>
   
   <ul>
   <li class="j"><b class="text-primary">Lesson Content:</b> a short introduction to the main points and ideas of a specific subject relevant to the topic of the week. </li>
   <li class="j"><b class="text-primary">Live the Lesson:</b> here you will find different kinds of activities that will enable you to put what you have learned into practice.</li>
   <li class="j"><b class="text-primary">Remember the Lesson:</b> this is a short phrase that sums up the lesson. The goal is that you would be able to easily remember what you have learned. </li>
   <li class="j"><b class="text-primary">Study the Word:</b> this is a Bible reading plan that will help you dig deeper into the Word of God. This plan is designed to help you invest 10 minutes every 
        day into reading the Scriptures. Given that some chapters are longer than others, it may seem like you have more to read on some days, 
        but you should, in fact, be reading for a similar amount of time every day. </li>
   </ul> 
    <p class="j">
        Over the next 63 days you will meet weekly as part of a group where a teacher will help you delve deeper into the topic for the week. You will also have the op-portunity 
        to hear about the personal experiences of people whose lives have been transformed by Christ and who have put the very things you are learning about 
        that week into practice. Each session will be interactive and informative and as a group you will oe axle to discuss any questions you may have. 
    </p>
    <p class="j">
        Our prayer is that you would grow <i>"until you reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ"</i> (Ephesians 4:13).
